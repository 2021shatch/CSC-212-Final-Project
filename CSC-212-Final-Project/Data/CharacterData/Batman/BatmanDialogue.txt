”You make my heart glow! You know this was exactly what my set-up was missing here: you in a human suit! Only someone who truly loves me would make such a sacrifice! Batman enlists the both of you on the American classic “The Bachelorette” where you two end up getting married after weeks of cheating and heartbreak. You end up living “happily ever after”.”
"Alfred can do better than this"
Well hello! So you want to date the Batman, huh? It’s not too hard. What I’m looking for is someone who gets me. Someone willing to dress up and go out on the town. 
No luck? No worries, sweet cheeks! I can give you another hint. This object is only accessible through vanity!
Okay, okay, here’s your last chance! I’m sorry but I cannot give you any more hints. I mean, if you were on Family Feud, this really wouldn’t slide. But, the key to my heart is in the dark! 
”Really? This? I had high hopes for you, but I should’ve known when you refused to watch football and eat Buffalo Wild Wings with me.” You absolutely break Batman’s heart and the rest of the suitors are so appalled that they banish you from the game.

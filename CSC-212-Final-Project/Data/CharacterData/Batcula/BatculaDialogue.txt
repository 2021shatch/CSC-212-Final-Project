"This isn't what I want!"
"So you want to win over the great Count!! Well, let me just tell you! The quest for my love is not easy! The thing I require is poetic and poured. Find it for me, and you’ll be adored!"
"Hmm, so you think you’re getting closer, huh? I don’t know about that! Find me something for a thirsty Count Bat!"
"Okay, okay last chance, I’m telling you! What I’m looking for is unique, special, it’s got its own hue!"
”Never in my life have I been this disrespected. After all the time we’ve spent getting to know each other, this is what you bring me!” In a passionate fury, Count Batula bites you and casts a spell on you, making all your other suitors repulsed by your efforts!"

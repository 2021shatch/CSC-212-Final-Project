“Ugh! You really shouldn’t have! You know I’ve been looking to do an exposé on Dr. Ant Fauci! These are the perfect incriminating photos of him and his great great ant bribing big pharma! That’s it, bring it in!” Bat Shapiro gets down on one knee and presents to you the most beautiful ring. He sweeps you off your feet and you run off into the back end of the Daily Wire Studio to get eloped. You lose all your dignity. I mean, really?? You wanted to marry Bat Shapiro?
"Not what I want! You only think about yourself!"
*in a nauseatingly nasal tone* “Well… uh… hello! You… ah, ah, ah… want to be my girlfriend, right? I mean I am handsome, I am perfect, I am the whole package. I am an elite politician with a thirst for drama, so I will always treat you right as long as you ah… ah… make me sandwiches and do your womanly duties.”
Okay, fine, yeah, whatever, I mean… you should really know what I’m looking for by now. It’s the only thing a skinny, aggressive, backwards politician would ever dream of! Just know, a picture says a thousand words!
Okay, so now you come crawling all the back to ole Batty boy here! You really haven’t figured it out yet? Women. Typical! I mean do I need to spell it out for you? What I’m looking for is a secret, some juicy drama, my next story!
”You’ve got to be kidding me?!? You’d really think that this was the key to my heart?? You must be delusional! A hypocrite!” Bat Shapiro gets pissed off! He kicks you out of the apartment and talks about you on his podcast with Jeroba Rogan. You become an embarrassment in your community for stooping so low as to debate Bat Shapiro. Now none of the suitors are interested in you.
